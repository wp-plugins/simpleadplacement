== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find the settings for the plugin? =
In the admin backend, look under Settings -> SimpleAdPlacement

= Why is the ad for "Above Footer" not showing up above the footer? =
Your footer div is probably not id'd as "footer" try to look in the source of your site to find the id of the footer and change it in the configuration tab.
